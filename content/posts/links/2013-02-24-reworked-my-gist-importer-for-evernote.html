title: Reworked my Gist importer for Evernote

<a href="https://github.com/mdp/GistEvernoteImport">Reworked my Gist importer for Evernote</a><br/><p>If your looking to import your Github gists into Evernote and make them searchable, this is your starting point.</p>
<p>The code is quite brittle, but it does the job, as I&#8217;ve been running it for around a year. Not something I&#8217;m looking to spend much time on, but feel free to run with it on your own; it&#8217;s MIT licensed and such.</p>

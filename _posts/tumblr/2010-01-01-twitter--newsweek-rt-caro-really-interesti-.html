<a href="http://twitter.com/Newsweek/status/7241302050">Twitter / Newsweek: RT @caro: Really interesti ...</a><br/><p>Come on guys. I cited <a title="Mark Gormley" target="_blank" href="http://www.markgormley.com/">Mark Gormley</a>, <a title="April Fools" href="http://www.snopes.com/holidays/aprilfools/cleaning.asp" target="_blank">Snopes</a>, and claimed the fees came from Internet Cleaning! I even made mention of TinyURL&#8217;s prototype - ReallyShortURLs.com* -  Clearly it&#8217;s a joke :)</p>

<p>* Get it? ReallyShortURLs.com. It&#8217;s long for no reason. So the goal was to make a short URL and he made it unnecessarily long. Oh nevermind!</p>

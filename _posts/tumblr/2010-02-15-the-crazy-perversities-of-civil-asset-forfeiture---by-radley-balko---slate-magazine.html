<p>These private attorneys, unaccountable to the public, are making decisions about which cases to go after that directly affect their own personal wealth. Steven Kessler, a New York attorney and author of a treatise on state forfeiture laws, says he&#8217;s never heard of anything like it. &#8220;This is scandalous,&#8221; Kessler told me in a phone interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s blatantly unconstitutional.&#8221;</p>

<p>Surprised? Not really.</p>

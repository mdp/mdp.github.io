One of the issues with letting people render any HTML they want on your domain is that nefarious users can render a password field on an official looking page and capture the input from the victim.
Tumblr seems to have come up strategy to try and prevent tricked users from entering their passwords.
View the source and you&amp;rsquo;ll see that they inject the following JS on the top of every page load before the &amp;lt;html&amp;gt; tag.</description></item><item><title>Hacking HTTPS -> HTTP referrers</title><link>http://mdp.github.io/2013/05/28/hacking-https-http-referrers.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mdp.github.io/2013/05/28/hacking-https-http-referrers.html</guid><description>There was an interesting article today on HTML5’s solution to solving the missing referrers problem in HTTPS -&amp;gt; HTTP transitions. But I thought I’d describe how Twitter’s t.co ‘fixed’ the problem.
Background The root of this problem is that when you click any HTTP link on an HTTPS hosted page the browser will strip any referrer info.
HTML5 is now allowing you to rectify this with a ‘meta’ tag to inform the browser that your HTTPS page outbound traffic is allowed to carry the referrer information to HTTP sites.</description></item><item><title>curl directly to a gist</title><link>http://mdp.github.io/2013/04/02/curl-directly-to-a-gist.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mdp.github.io/2013/04/02/curl-directly-to-a-gist.html</guid><description>I was messing with my Raspberry Pi via ssh tonight and wanted to quickly stash a file to gist.github.com.
One option, I can install the command line gist tool.
But wouldn’t it be nice if you could just curl the content of the file directly to Gist
$ curl --data-binary @README.md http://cist.herokuapp.com/read.md #&amp;gt; https://gist.github.com/32d1b11087f326a9653f Much better. If you want to run your own curl to gist bridge, see the code at https://github.</description></item><item><title>Reworked my Gist importer for Evernote</title><link>http://mdp.github.io/2013/02/24/reworked-my-gist-importer-for-evernote.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mdp.github.io/2013/02/24/reworked-my-gist-importer-for-evernote.html</guid><description>Reworked my Gist importer for EvernoteIf your looking to import your Github gists into Evernote and make them searchable, this is your starting point.
The code is quite brittle, but it does the job, as I&amp;#8217;ve been running it for around a year. Not something I&amp;#8217;m looking to spend much time on, but feel free to run with it on your own; it&amp;#8217;s MIT licensed and such.

But I thought I’d describe how Twitter’s t.co ‘fixed’ the problem.
Background The root of this problem is that when you click any HTTP link on an HTTPS hosted page the browser will strip any referrer info.
HTML5 is now allowing you to rectify this with a ‘meta’ tag to inform the browser that your HTTPS page outbound traffic is allowed to carry the referrer information to HTTP sites.</description></item><item><title>curl directly to a gist</title><link>http://mdp.github.io/2013/04/02/curl-directly-to-a-gist.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mdp.github.io/2013/04/02/curl-directly-to-a-gist.html</guid><description>I was messing with my Raspberry Pi via ssh tonight and wanted to quickly stash a file to gist.github.com.
One option, I can install the command line gist tool.
But wouldn’t it be nice if you could just curl the content of the file directly to Gist
$ curl --data-binary @README.md http://cist.herokuapp.com/read.md #&amp;gt; https://gist.github.com/32d1b11087f326a9653f Much better. If you want to run your own curl to gist bridge, see the code at https://github.</description></item></channel></rss>
